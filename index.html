                    <p>
                        Because of the slowdown in business that came as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, and a general sense that
                        I was not satisfied with the direction of my technology career. I decided to take some time to focus on 
                        changing directions into healthcare.

                    <strong>📓 General Notes</strong>
                    <p>
                        I see my career as being divided between Pre/Post Covid, hence the two Github profiles. 
                        Before Covid, I saw myself becoming a career software engineer and was interested in learning
                        all that I could about Web and Mobile Technologies. <br><br>
                        After Covid, I see technology as a tool moreso than anything else, and use my "new" Github as a 
                        storage site for the bits of Python and JavaScript I practice as a hobby. When I'm "coding", 
                        I'm probably in a Jupyter Notebook doing some quick visualizations, or working on a Mern app 
                        I keep for fun.
